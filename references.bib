	abstract = {In this paper, we describe an experiment that compared the use of a Tangible User Interface (physical objects augmented with digital information) and a set of Contrasting Cases as a preparation for future learning. We carried out an experiment (N = 40) with a 2 × 2 design: the first factor compared traditional instruction (BTell \& Practice{\textasciicircum}) with a constructivist activity designed using the Preparation for Future Learning framework (PFL). The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that dyads of students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional BTell \& Practice{\textasciicircum} instruction (large effect size). A similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small-to-moderate effect size). We discuss implications for designing socio-constructivist activities using new computer interfaces.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, the integration of coding activities for children in K-12 education has flourished. In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.},

Studies were summarized under several themes including the research purpose, design, methodology, sampling characteristics, data analysis, and main findings. The findings were reported using descriptive statistics to see the trends. It was observed that there was an increase in the number of CT studies in recent years, and these were mainly conducted in the field of computer sciences. In addition, CT studies were mostly published in journals in the field of Education and Instructional Technologies. Theoretical paradigm and literature review design were preferred more in previous studies. The most commonly used sampling method was the purposive sampling. It was also revealed that samples of previous CT studies were generally pre-college students. Written data collection tools and quantitative analysis were mostly used in reviewed papers. Findings mainly focused on CT skills. Based on current findings, recommendations and implications for further researches were provided.},

Here we report on a study of programing by children aged 7 – 11 using Java and elements of computational thinking they experience.

We compare novice (children’s) processes of coding an animated story with that of experts (college students) and evaluate the differences using four measures based on the progressive coding of a complete program. We also analyze the use of novice (children’s) computational thinking in this coding process.

Background: There is a growing pressure to begin teaching computational thinking at a young age. This study explores the affordances of two very different programming interfaces for teaching computational thinking: a graphical coding application on the iPad (ScratchJr) and tangible programmable robotics kit (KIBO).
        
Methodology	: This study used a mixed-method approach to explore the learning experiences that young children have with tangible and graphical coding interfaces. A sample of children ages four to seven (N = 28) participated.   

Findings: Results suggest that type of user interface does have an impact on children’s learning, but is only one of many factors that affect positive academic and socio-emotional experiences. Tangible and graphical interfaces each have qualities that foster different types of learning},

However, how different input and output modalities in coding tools affect coding as a problem-solving process remains unclear. Of interest are the advantages and disadvantages of graphical and tangible interfaces for teaching coding to children. We conducted four kids coding workshops to study how different input and output methods in coding affected the problem-solving process and class dynamics. Results revealed that graphical input could keep children focused on problem solving better than tangible input, but it was less provocative for class discussion. Tangible output supported better schema construction and casual reasoning and promoted more active class engagement than graphical output but offered less affordance for analogical comparison among problems. We also derived insights for designing new tools and teaching methods for kids coding.},

The students had prior experience with the two interfaces, having used them in a previous study, a year earlier. In the present work, students started programming in dyads and used both interfaces (graphical - tangible) once again, but without scaffolding and user instructions. Initially, the students carried out programming tasks and then they were allowed to freely interact with the system and develop their programs in order to explore programming concepts on their own. Quantitative and qualitative analysis were based on Fun Toolkit survey, interviews, computer logs, and video records. Usability analysis focused on retention, error rate, and convenience and showed that although no difference between the two interfaces recorded, students’ perceived impression on retention was in favor of the tangible interface. Moreover, interaction with the tangible interface was perceived as more playful by all students and more appropriate for collaborative work by elder students and girls. Finally, gender effects regarding students’ preferences, mostly on the graphical interface, were recorded and analyzed.},

O processo de design envolveu dois grupos de 25 crianças (todas com 5 anos). A primeira atividade foii trabalhada com 3 crianças por vez, a fim de identificar os tipos de histórias criadas pelas crianças. A maioria das histórias era sobre a rotinha diária das crianças, da família e amigos.
Some of the children grabbed all the cards they liked without really thinking about the story that they wanted to create and began to place them on the platform; others took their time to reflect about what they wanted to tell, and looked for very specific cards.
The system reads the cards following the order they have entered it, this means that the children can place a card on the bottom of the platform and then continue placing the next card on the middle of the platform, jumping back and forth as they create their story.

As the boundary between physical and digital worlds blurs, there is a need for new digital tools and physical environments to support the everyday, cyber–physical interactions of children. This paper presents a Research-through-Design example of CyberPLAYce, a tangible, interactive, learning construction kit for children supporting storytelling and computational thinking (CT). The construction kit facilitates and enhances child-to-child, child-to-machine, and childto-environment interactions through semi-structured play. It offers young students the opportunity to materialize their ideas through the construction of cyber–physical story algorithms allowing them to physically alter story segments while constructing and enhancing the storyline. The CyberPLAYce research places an emphasis on the importance of employing tangible learning tools in order to enhance children’s active engagement. We focus on the motivations for CyberPLAYce, its participatory design, and results of an empirical study concerning CT with 8-12 year-old storytellers in a classroom setting. Results from the study suggest that cyber–physical activities afforded by CyberPLAYce cultivate engaged storytelling and CT practices in children. This multidisciplinary design-research contributes to construction tools for children, cyber–physical storytelling and story-construction activities, and tangible computing and programming activities that support CT.},

In this chapter, we discuss a growing space of interfaces in which physical objects play a central role as both physical representations and controls for digital information. We present an interaction model and key characteristics for such “tangible user interfaces,” and explore these characteristics in a number of interface examples. This discussion supports a newly integrated view of both recent and previous work, and points the way towards new kinds of computationally-mediated interfaces that more seamlessly weave together the physical and digital worlds.},

The current study set out to conduct an in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of both interfaces, based on a comparison between similar TUI and GUI versions of a modeling and simulation system called “FlowBlocks”. Results showed most users preferred the TUI version over the GUI version. This is a surprising ﬁnding, considering both versions were equivalent in regard to most performance parameters, and the TUI version was even perceived as inferior to the GUI version in regard to usability. Interviews with users revealed this preference stemmed from high levels of stimulation and enjoyment, derived from three TUI properties: physical interaction, rich feedback, and high levels of realism. Potential underlying mechanisms for these ﬁndings and practical implications are discussed.},

In this paper, we present a study comparing the use of a tangible and a graphical interface as part of an interactive computer programming and robotics exhibit that we designed for the Boston Museum of Science. In this study, we have collected observations of 260 museum visitors and conducted interviews with 13 family groups. Our results show that visitors found the tangible and the graphical systems equally easy to understand. However, with the tangible interface, visitors were significantly more likely to try the exhibit and significantly more likely to actively participate in groups. In turn, we show that regardless of the condition, involving multiple active participants leads to significantly longer interaction times. Finally, we examine the role of children and adults in each condition and present evidence that children are more actively involved in the tangible condition, an effect that seems to be especially strong for girls.},

	abstract = {A Matemática tem sido apontada como uma disciplina que contribui significativamente para elevação das taxas de retenção nas escolas brasileiras. Resultados do Sistema Nacional de Avaliação da Educação Básica (SAEB), realizado em 2003, mostram que há inúmeras dificul- dades com a Educação Matemática no Brasil. Os materiais concretos, ou manipulativos, são recursos muito usados pelos professores do Ensino Fundamental como auxílio para ensinar conceitos matemáticos. Pesquisas indicam resultados positivos quando tais materiais são empregados adequadamente. No entanto, ma- nipulativos possuem limitações e parecem não ser suficientes para superar as barreiras de com- preensão que se repetem ao longo dos anos nas escolas. Um outro tipo de recurso que tem se tornado cada vez mais popular nas escolas são os computadores pessoais. Porém, ainda não existe um consenso nem uma prática estabelecida para o uso de computadores na Educação de forma efetiva para a aprendizagem. As interfaces tangíveis para a Educação representam uma alternativa ao uso dos computa- dores pessoais, propondo que computação seja embutida em objetos físicos para criar um novo tipo de recurso didático. Dessa forma, as interfaces tangíveis unem as vantagens da manipu- lação física às formas inovadoras de interação providas pela computação, enriquecendo assim a experiência de aprendizagem. O objetivo deste trabalho é projetar uma interface tangível para auxiliar a aprendizagem de frações no Ensino Fundamental brasileiro. Para isso, propomos uma metodologia de design baseada em contexto, que leva em consideração aspectos sócio-culturais, aspectos práticos de sala de aula e aspectos de interação e de aprendizagem. O estudo do contexto de uso do futuro produto, realizado através de observações e entre- vistas, nos permitiu elicitar requisitos dos usuários e requisitos técnicos do produto. Através de sessões de resolução de tarefas com os alunos, identificamos algumas necessidades relacionadas à aprendizagem de frações. Tais resultados nos levaram a propor uma interface tangível que acreditamos ser útil, viável e adequada à realidade das salas de aula e das crianças brasileiras.},

A dificuldade em formar engenheiros no Brasil é uma realidade consolidada, tendo como um dos principais motivos a dificuldade por parte dos estudantes em assimilar matérias ligadas a matemática, lógica e inovação. Esta pesquisa buscou utilizar o pensamento computacional, através do uso de brinquedos de programar, como ferramenta para proporcionar o desenvolvimento de conhecimentos ligados a engenharia em crianças. Portanto, o objetivo desta pesquisa foi desenvolver uma metodologia para aplicação de brinquedos programáveis como ferramenta de desenvolvimento de habilidades comuns à engenharia. Dentre as metodologias abordadas nesta pesquisa, estão a exploratória e pesquisa bibliográfica. Um grupo amostral composto por nove crianças entre três e quatro anos de idade foi submetido a uma sequência de atividades envolvendo o uso de um brinquedo de programar como ferramenta para resolução de problemas. A análise das interações deste grupo com o brinquedo de programar foi realizada com base na metodologia Behavior Based Progress. Esta pesquisa também utilizou pela primeira vez o brinquedo RoPE, criado pelo Laboratório de Inovação Tecnológica na Educação e permitiu validar uma série de características para concepção do produto. O uso do brinquedo com os educadores também permitiu identificar que o uso de metodologias colaborativas como o Design Thinking, enriquecem o desenvolvimento de um produto pela constante interação com os envolvidos no processo. Os resultados das atividades demonstraram que as habilidades relacionadas à engenharia, identificadas nesta pesquisa, são utilizadas pelas crianças quando estas participam das atividades propostas pela metodologia elaborada nesta pesquisa. A correlação de Pearson obtida entre os grupos de crianças apresentou um valor de 0,99, este valor indica que os envolvidos avançaram na resolução dos problemas com auto grau de correlação.},

The communication between the toy and the graphic interface intends to commands remain synchronized. Computational Thinking (CT) is one of the theoretical basis for RoPE's development. CT is currently  being included in the developed countries educational curricula, in order to train people to act in a world where technology is present, but is little understood. This project deals with Computational Thinking in Early Childhood Education by describing a set of teaching tools, including ScratchJr, the hybrid language CHERP and the Blockly library. Since RoPE currently doesn't communicate with external devices, it has been verified and confirmed the possibility of attaching a Bluetooth for Arduino adapter module on the toy board. The HM-10 module was chosen due to compatibility with the standard known as Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth Low Energy. In the graphical part, the communication technology selected was the Bluetooth Web API, which intends to allow Bluetooth interaction through browsers. This technology was chosen in order to take advantage of browser portability. The specific objectives addressed in the project phase were the specification of the software requirements, survey of structural adaptations in the toy (module connection) and defining a block programming language able to reflect RoPE's  commands. In the development phase the toy was adapted, allowing external communication, and it is not necessary to mount a voltage reducer. The block based graphic screen was developed and tested on devices running Google Chrome in the Android operating system. An increase adapted toy execution time, in relation to the original toy, was detected by the t test. Tests with 24 children aged from 3 to 6 years old indicate that solving problems through the graphic interface required more effort when compared to using only the toy.},

	abstract = {Computational Thinking and logical reasoning increase the ability to deduce and solve problems. Computational thinking allows new ways of thinking and is associated with the exercise of programming, which can be done in a tangible way without the use of personal computers. Programming toys are toys that develop programming concepts and algorithms in a playful way and can stimulate computational thinking in children already in their early school stages. This work proposes to develop the prototype of a programming interface for the RoPE bundle, which enables the stimulation of computational thinking in children through activities that involve storytelling. To achieve this goal, similar works are presented in the literature, suitable electronic components for the creation of the prototype, importance of tangible approaches to learning, importance of the drawing exercise for children and the maturing stages of the drawing. Such knowledge was used to construct a functional prototype of the programming interface and apply tests to verify its operation. The idea of the tool is to bring the teaching of algorithms and programming in a playful way for the initial period of fundamental education and to approach the activities already carried out in the children's daily
life.},

To address this problem, we present a taxonomy, which uses metaphor and embodiment as its two axes. This 2D space treats tangibility as a spectrum rather than a binary quantity. The further from the origin, the more ‘‘tangible’’ a system is. We show that this spectrum-based taxonomy oﬀers multiple advantages. It uniﬁes previous categorizations and deﬁnitions, integrates the notion of ‘‘calm computing,’’ reveals a previously un-noticed trend in the ﬁeld, and suggests design principles appropriate for diﬀerent areas of the spectrum.},

	abstract = {Programming is more than just coding, for, it exposes students to computational thinking which involves problem-solving using computer science concepts like abstraction and decomposition. Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reﬂection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.},

However, how such modulation is shaped by experience and reflected behaviorally remains unclear. This study evaluates the visual cortex activity and functional connectivity among congenitally blind, acquired blind, and sighted subjects using bloodoxygenation-level-dependent functional MRI during sensory substitution tasks and at rest. We found that primary visual cortex activity due to active interpretation not only depends on the blindness duration, but also negatively associates with behavioral reaction time. In addition, alterations in visual and task-positive functional connectivity progress over the duration of blindness. In summary, this work suggests that functional plasticity in the primary visual cortex can be reshaped in the blind over time, even in the adult stage. Furthermore, the degree of top-down activity in the primary visual cortex may reflect the speed of performance during sensory substitution.},

	abstract = {One of the factors leading to the virtual neglect of the long-term potential for functional recovery following brain damage was the eclipse of plasticity concepts during the 100 years following Broca’s 1861 publication on location of function. However, in the last 30 years evidence has been accumulating that demonstrates the plasticity of the brain and thus recovery potential is a subject of practical as well as theoretical interest. “Unmasking” of relatively inactive pathways, the taking over of functional representation by undamaged brain tissue. and neuronal group selection are among the mechanisms that are being explored. Human models of recovery of function include hemispherectomy patients that have regained bilateral function, facial paralysis patients who recover function (with appropriate rehabilitation) after VII-XII cranial nerve anastomosis. and patients with muscle transpositions to re-establish lost motor functions. The role of early and late rehabilitation, with attention to psychosocial and environmental factors, appears to be critical for recovery.},

Accounting for the advantages and conventional gains of learning through physical books and printed matter in general, this paper presents an approach towards augmenting both such media. This work has elementary school as a context and presents an approach towards augmenting a physical book and associated learning cards, with the purpose of providing a playful approach to learning the alphabet. The two principal activities involved in studying from an elementary school book are augmented: learning, during which the student receives information about letters, phonemes, and words, and practicing where questions are asked to the young student in order to consolidate the recently acquired knowledge. The proposed implementation is evaluated initially as to its performance and accuracy and then as to its usability and suitability for efficient and intuitive interaction.},

Methods. Descriptive survey study in public schools in three municipalities of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The sample comprised 134 teachers.
Results. According to the teachers’ opinions, there are differences in the specificities and applicability of assistive technology for blind and low-vision students, for whom specific computer programs are important. Information technology enhances reading and writing skills, as well as communication with the world on an equal basis, thereby improving quality of life and facilitating the learning process. The main reason for not using information technology is the lack of planning courses. The main requirements for the use of information technology in schools are enough computers for all students, advisers to help teachers, and pedagogical support.
Conclusions. Assistive technology is applied to education of students with visual impairment; however, teachers indicate the need for infrastructure and pedagogical support. Information technology is an important tool in the inclusion process and can promote independence and autonomy of students with visual impairment.},

Based on this hypothesis, we present, in a tone of critical balance, reﬂections on the “Decade of Literacy” in order to contribute to the discussion of problems and perspectives for teaching reading and writing in Brazil.},

Discutem-se as causas dessa perda de especificidade do processo de alfabetização, e propõe-se uma distinção entre alfabetização e letramento que preserve a peculiaridade de cada um desses processos, ao mesmo tempo em que se afirma sua indissociabilidade e interdependência. Caracteriza-se o momento atual como sendo de tentativas de reinvenção da alfabetização, considerada necessária desde que entendida não como a volta a paradigmas do passado, mas como recuperação da especificidade da alfabetização em suas múltiplas facetas, e sua integração com o processo de letramento.

            Describes how the concepts of literacy and initial reading instruction developed in Brazilian education throughout the last two decades, characterising this development as a progressive invention of the word and concept of literacy and a concomitant dis-invention of the concept of initial reading instruction, which lost its specific characteristics, bringing about a new type of school failure: the serious reading and writing difficulties among students at advanced levels of schooling. The text discusses the causes of this phenomenon and stresses the need to distinguish clearly between initial reading instruction and literacy, so that each process is seen as specific and, at the same time, as associated with and dependent on the other. The present situation is characterised as an attempt to re-invent initial reading instruction, meaning not a turning back to past methodologies, but as a recovery of the distinctive features of the initial reading instruction process in its multiple facets, guaranteeing at the same time its integration with the literacy process.},

We discuss how some widely held qualities often put forward with tangible interfaces were given up in favour of reaching overall goals of interaction. In particular our design involved a shift from a focus on persistent representation and readability of tangible code structures, to instead focus on achieving reusability of programming resources. On a general level, our results illustrate a view on tangibles as resources for action instead of only as alternative forms of data representation. Importantly, this view includes action directed towards the computer as well as off-line socially oriented action conducted with the tangible artefacts.},

This paper describes the development of KIBO, a newly created robotics kit for children ages 4-7 developed at Tufts University through funding from the National Science Foundation. Designed explicitly for very young children, the KIBO kit has gone through several design iterations based on feedback from teachers and children over the past three years. The newest version of KIBO allows young children to become engineers by constructing robots using motors, sensors, and craft materials. Children also become programmers by exploring sequences, loops, and variables. In line with screen-time recommendations for young children, KIBO is programmed to move using tangible programming blocks- no computer, tablet, or screen required.},

Data show that all students can intuitively learn sequence, conditional, loops and parameters and that girls performed slightly better than boys. Older students can easily combine these concepts to write a program. The multilanguage platform promotes student spontaneous exploration of more sophisticated CS concepts and languages. These ﬁndings imply that introducing CS in mandatory schooling from an inquiry based approach is both achievable and beneﬁcial.},

Muitas são as dificuldades apresentadas pelos estudantes, principalmente relacionadas à compreensão e interpretação do enunciado. Esta pesquisa analisou os enunciados apresentados nos livros didáticos mais frequentemente adotados em universidades brasileiras, e constatou que geralmente são objetivos, sem indícios do processo de resolução, sem exemplificação e com um contexto predominantemente matemático. Nesse cenário formulou-se a questão de pesquisa: a estrutura e/ou o contexto de um enunciado podem influenciar o desempenho dos alunos, de programação introdutória na resolução de problemas? A estrutura está relacionada aos elementos que constam no enunciado para auxiliar o estudante a compreendê-lo tais como exemplos, casos de testes ou indícios da solução. O contexto se refere ao tema/enredo da questão. Partiu-se da crença de que em contextos que o estudante possui maior familiaridade, como jogos, compreenderá melhor os problemas e poderá ter melhor desempenho. Para responder esta questão realizou-se uma pesquisa experimental para avaliar a influência dos enunciados no desempenho dos estudantes ao resolverem problemas de programação introdutória. Foram propostos problemas usando dois contextos: matemático e jogos e dois tipos de estrutura: estruturado e não estruturado formando assim quatro grupos de tratamento. No experimento participaram 246 estudantes de oito turmas de seis instituições de ensino superior de três diferentes estados de diferentes regiões geográficas do Brasil. Os resultados apontaram que os estudantes tiveram melhor desempenho quando os enunciados são estruturados e que este é acentuado quando o contexto é matemático.  Não foi encontrada nenhuma evidência de que a utilização do contexto de jogos nos enunciados favoreceu o desempenho. O pior desempenho ocorreu o grupo de questões do contexto matemático não estruturado, justamente o modelo de enunciado mais frequentemente encontrado nos livros didáticos, o que leva a conclusão de que é necessário repensar a forma de apresentar os problemas aos estudantes de programação introdutória.},

	title = {Intelligent tutoring system for learning {PHP}},
	abstract = {Teaching introductory programming has challenged educators for decades. Of the
many suggested methods of improving the teaching process, individual tutoring has
proven to be very effective. However, individual tutoring with human tutors requires
a large amount of resources and is therefore impractical to use with the vast number
of students who want to learn programming. A viable alternative is to use Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITSs) for this purpose. Although some ITSs have been built to
teach programming, none have been developed to address the subject of web
programming, which is becoming increasingly popular. This thesis addresses this
gap by designing, building and evaluating an Intelligent Tutoring System to teach
web development using PHP.
Any system that teaches programming needs to provide practical exercises for the
students. In order for the students to learn from the system, it is necessary for them
to receive feedback on their solutions to the exercises. A major challenge here is that
a programming problem rarely has a unique solution. For a system to be effective, it
is necessary that it be capable of handling many alternative solutions to a given
programming exercise. This thesis concentrates on achieving this objective using the
theories of artificial intelligence. The system converts the student‟s solution into a
set of predicates. These predicates are then compared against an overall goal which
is also depicted as a set of predicates. Any missing predicates are used to identify
sub-goals of the programming exercise that are not met and to provide relevant
feedback.
The PHP ITS customises the instructions for individual students by providing
guidance for each student on the next best exercise he/she should attempt. This is
done by dividing the subject matter into topics and storing a probabilistic estimate as
to each student‟s current knowledge of that topic. The estimates are updated based
on each solution that the student submits for the exercises. The knowledge level of
each topic and the topics covered by each exercise are utilised to find the exercise
that has the least number of topics that are not known to the current student. This
ensures that the student will learn something new by attempting this exercise, while
reducing the amount of new material so as not to overload the student.
These concepts were used to build a web-based Intelligent Tutoring System. The
system was evaluated on two sets of students at the Queensland University of
Technology. The students were given a pre-test to measure their knowledge of the
subject matter. Then, they used the system for six weeks during their own time to
solve exercises. Finally, they were given a post-test to gauge whether their
knowledge had improved. They were also given a questionnaire to measure their
acceptance of the system.
The results of a paired t-test showed that the student‟s knowledge increased
significantly as a result of using the system. They also showed that the system‟s
gauge of the knowledge level of each student was successful in predicting their final
test scores, indicating that the gauge was fairly accurate. Analysis of qualitative data
also showed that the students were relatively satisfied with the system overall.
Although it is possible to improve the system further, the evaluation process showed
that the PHP ITS can be used effectively to teach PHP web development to beginners
in web programming.},

	title = {Evasão na disciplina de algoritmo e programação: um estudo a partir dos fatores intervenientes na perspectiva do aluno},
	isbn = {978-84-15302-71-1},
	abstract = {No Brasil cada vez mais os alunos chegam à universidade com deficiências na sua
formação básica. Deficiências estas relacionadas à expressão em língua materna (escrita),
interpretação de textos e enunciados, hábitos de estudo e pesquisa e, especialmente, com
formação deficitária no que tange a conteúdos de Matemática. Estas deficiências têm sido
apontadas como fatores impactantes e relacionados com o cancelamento ou abandono na
disciplina de Algoritmos e Programação. Estudos brasileiros e internacionais apontam para a
necessidade de se criar estratégias e programas de incentivo a permanência nestas disciplinas
do primeiro ano dos cursos de Computação. No entanto, maioria dos estudos apresenta a
perspectiva do professor e sua observação acerca dos fatores que ele/ela julga intervenientes
no processo de evasão. Geralmente estes fatores são oriundos de elementos da avaliação
formal (testes, exercícios e provas). O diferencial deste trabalho foi buscar na fala dos alunos
a sua perspectiva e verificar o quanto esta geração conectada realmente abandona a disciplina
por razões de falta de pré-requisitos. Buscou-se identificar que outros fatores motivacionais,
estruturais e socioeconômicos levou estes alunos a desistirem, do estudo naquelas disciplinas.
Este estudo constitui-se numa análise qualitativa, descritiva, com estudo de caso, contando,
para tal, com levantamento bibliográfico e pesquisa de campo, com apoio nos testemunhos de
alunos de cursos de graduação dos cursos de Sistemas de Informação de Ciência da
Computação da PUCRS, no período de 2012 a 2013, que abandonaram ou cancelaram a
disciplina antes do término do período letivo. A coleta de informações deu-se por meio de
questionário online enviado aos alunos que cancelaram as disciplinas. A seleção deste aluno
foi realizada pelo registro de cancelamentos nas salas virtuais associadas às turmas de
Algoritmo Programação I, no referido período estudo de caso a que se refere essa pesquisa, o
a perspectiva e opinião dos alunos das causas que os levaram a abandonar ou cancelar a
disciplina, é do tipo analítico, porque se constitui, primeiramente, pelo caráter descritivo.
Segundo Yin (2010) são os estudos de caso de cunho analítico os que podem proporcionar
significativo avanço no conhecimento real do contexto. Assim, essa abordagem se integra aos
interesses da pesquisa, porque permite voltar o olhar para o processo de desistência por parte
os alunos dos seus estudos. A análise dos dados foi enriquecida com as contribuições nas
questões abertas utilizando a na Análise Textual Discursiva de Moraes e Galiazzi, (2006).},

	title = {Uma {Arquitetura} de tutor utilizando estados mentais},
	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/10183/17620},
	abstract = {Esta tese situa-se na área de IA (Inteligência Artificial) aplicada à educação incluindo características interdisciplinares tanto da própria IA como de IE (informática na Educação). Faz-se também necessário constarem, aspectos referentes à Ciência da Computação e Educação a fim de melhor situar a complexidade e a dimensão do trabalho desenvolvido. A utilização de técnicas de IA na elaboração e no desenvolvimento de ambientes de ensino-aprendizagem computadorizados tem se constituído em objeto de investigação por parte dos pesquisadores da área de Informática aplicada à Educação, devido as suas potencialidades. A utilização de agentes na modelagem e no projeto de STI permite-nos resgatar antigos problemas em aberto, como por exemplo a melhoria da interação entre tutor e aluno e a possibilidade de investigação dos processos mentais em nível mais estratificado. A arquitetura descrita nesta tese utiliza a metodologia que vem sendo aplicada ao projeto de STI, onde são contempladas diferentes formas de se trabalhar com um determinado conhecimento (estratégias de ensino e táticas associadas), levando-se em consideração o tipo de usuário que está interagindo com o sistema. A arquitetura, elaborada segundo uma abordagem construtivista, prevê que o tutor seja menos diretivo e menos controlador das ações do aluno. O controle é feito na forma de monitoração para que o tutor funcione como um parceiro, ou seja, como facilitador do trabalho do aluno. Contudo, devido às características da modalidade escolhida para construção do protótipo (jogo educacional), precisamos ter algumas atitudes no tutor que garantam que o sistema não entre em colapso. O que inviabilizaria o trabalho do aluno. Nestas situações críticas, o tutor vai se comportar de maneira mais diretiva. Cabe salientar que a abordagem construtivista não significa dar liberdade total ao aluno nem privá-lo de qualquer tipo de assistência. Portanto, o que deve ser destacado é o grau de interferência do tutor, i.e., o quanto ele interfere no trabalho do aluno e se ele permite ou não que o aluno siga um caminho alternativo àquele que ele tem como o ideal para resolver o problema (heurísticas do tutor sobre o problema e forma de solução). Além destes aspectos educacionais inerentes a todo o projeto de software educacional (necessários num trabalho desta natureza), esta tese está inserida no contexto da pesquisa em agentes cognitivos modelados através de seus estados mentais. É importante salientar que os estados mentais utilizados neste trabalho (crenças, desejos, intenções e expectativas) funcionam como uma metáfora dos estudos mentais humanos. Por exemplo, quando se coloca a crença de um aluno a respeito de "lago", na realidade está se colocando a crença que temos a respeito da crença que o aluno possui a respeito de "lago". O mesmo acontece com os outros estados mentais aqui utilizados. Os diálogos reais foram registrados através de observação direta e posteriormente analisados a fim de se identificar os estados mentais relacionados. Perguntas adicionais foram feitas no sentido de obterem-se mais elementos para auxiliar na inferência do conjunto de estados mentais que o aluno possui naquele momento em que estava jogando. Após a observação de vários alunos jogando, identificou-se um certo padrão nas suas atitudes quando executavam uma ação. Observações sucessivas permitiram delinear o conjunto de estados mentais associados à ação do aluno. Tal conjunto foi utilizado como base para elaboração da coreografia. Estes dados servem de entrada para a construção do modelo do aluno mediante a interação com o tutor. No presente trabalho, nós apresentamos a modelagem de um STI através do uso da tecnologia de agentes utilizando a arquitetura de SMA (Sistemas Multiagentes). O STI é concebido como um SMA híbrido composto por um ambiente reativo (SMAR - Sistema Multiagente Reativo) e um "kernel" cognitivo (SMAC - Sistema Multiagente Cognitivo). O SMAR e o SMAC interagem entre si de para ampliar as informações quantitativas e qualitativas oferecidas aos alunos que utilizam o sistema. Estas informações disponíveis é que irão permitir ao tutor selecionar estratégias de ensino mais adequadas a um determinado tipo de aluno. A principal contribuição desta tese está centrada no "kernel" cognitivo. Nós propomos uma arquitetura para o tutor que permitirá a monitoração de dois alunos trabalhando conjuntamente. Além disso, propomos uma forma de selecionar o comportamento do tutor para oferecer auxílio personalizado aos alunos considerando o perfil de cada um. Esta arquitetura pretende ser uma alternativa de solução para uma questão importante na área de STI: Como o tutor pode selecionar, entre várias estratégias de ensino, a mais adequada para cada perfil de aluno? O grupo de pesquisa no qual este trabalho está inserido (GIA/UFRGS, sob orientação da Prof.a. Rosa Maria Viccari) tem realizado algumas avaliações experimentais, usando STI tradicionais e STI projetados e modelados através de sistemas multiagentes As contribuições científicas listadas no texto deste trabalho possibilitaram que o grupo avançasse sua pesquisa na abordagem mentalística através da criação de uma arquitetura para o tutor e favorecesse a integração do trabalho desenvolvido por Móra et al. [MOR97; MOR98]. A utilização do modelo computacional de agentes criado por Móra et al. gerou a implementação do "kernel" cognitivo. Os desafios inerentes a implementação da arquitetura proposta para o tutor ampliaram as características do ambiente criado por Móra et al. e favorecem a junção de dois trabalhos de tese supervisionados pela mesma orientadora [MOR99]. Portanto, a nova arquitetura proporcionou ganhos tanto para tais pesquisas, como para o avanço das pesquisas desenvolvidas pelo nosso grupo.},

X-Learn is characterized by the following features: (i) it is highly subjective, since it handles quite a rich and detailed user proﬁle that plays a key role during the learning activities; (ii) it is dynamic and ﬂexible, i.e. it is capable of reacting to variations in user exigencies and objectives; (iii) it is device-adaptive, since it decides the learning objects to present to the user on the basis of the device he is currently using; (iv) it is generic, i.e. it is capable of operating in a large variety of learning contexts; (v) it is XML based, since it exploits many facilities of XML technology for handling and exchanging information related to e-learning activities.

The research design is quasi-experimental, with pre-test and post-test measures, using experimental and control groups. The sample consists of 131 students from the second cycle of early education (between 3 and 6 years old), all from the same Spanish school. Computational thinking is measured through three dimensions: sequences (algorithms), action-instruction correspondence and debugging. The intervention sessions, as well as the structure of the challenges that were used in the pre- and post-test evaluations, were designed based on the reference program of robotics studies called “TangibleK”. The intervention, carried out doing learning activities using educational robotics resources, presents positive results in relation to the computational thinking skills achieved. The differences between the pre-test and the post-test in the experimental and control groups are statistically significant, in that children engaged in robotics program achieves a greater advance in the three dimensions of computational competence through this method.},

	abstract = {This article describes the TangibleK robotics program for young children. Based on over a decade of research, this program is grounded on the belief that teaching children about the human-made world, the realm of technology and engineering, is as important as teaching them about the natural world, numbers, and letters. The TangibleK program uses robotics as a tool to engage children in developing computational thinking and learning about the engineering design process. It includes a research-based, developmentally appropriate robotics kit that children can use to make robots and program their behaviors. The curriculum has been piloted in kindergarten classrooms and in summer camps and lab settings. The author presents the theoretical framework that informs TangibleK and the “powerful ideas” from computer science and robotics on which the curriculum is based, linking them to other disciplinary areas and developmental characteristics of early childhood. The article concludes with a description of classroom pedagogy and activities, along with assessment tools used to evaluate learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {This study explored the ways that the Computational Thinking (CT) process can be evaluated in a classroom environment. Thirty Children aged 10–11 years, from a primary school in London took part in a game-making project using the Scratch and Alice 2.4 applications for eight months. For the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and children’s completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. The discussions around what CT consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (AI), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. This also emphasised the role of metacognition in the Computational Thinking process. These arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate Computational Thinking using only programming constructs, as CT process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. Therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the Computational Thinking Process. Using the support of literature review and the findings of the data analysis I proposed a multiple approach evaluation model where ‘computational concepts’, ‘metacognitive practices’, and ‘learning behaviours’ were discussed as the main elements of the CT process. Additionally, in order to investigate these dimensions within a game-making context, computer game design was also included in this evaluation model.},

This study investigated: (1) the deﬁnition of robotics education; (2) thematic patterns of key ﬁndings; and (3) theoretical and methodological traits. The results of the review present a limitation of previous research in that it has focused on robotics education only as an instrumental means to support other subjects or STEM education. This study identiﬁes that the ﬁndings of the existing research are weighted toward outcome-focused research. Lastly, this study addresses the fact that most of the existing studies used constructivist and constructionist frameworks not only to design and implement robotics curricula but also to analyze young children’s engagement in robotics education. Relying on the ﬁndings of the review, this study suggests clarifying and specifying robotics-intensiﬁed knowledge, skills, and attitudes in deﬁning robotics education in connection to computer science education. In addition, this study concludes that research agendas need to be diversiﬁed and the diversity of research participants needs to be broadened. To do this, this study suggests employing social and cultural theoretical frameworks and critical analytical lenses by considering children’s historical, cultural, social, and institutional contexts in understanding young children’s engagement in robotics education.},

The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75\% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.},

This paper aims to review the empirical evidence on the application of robotics in mathematics education and to define future research perspectives of robot-assisted mathematics education. After a systematic search in online database via keyword search and snowballing approach, we analyzed 20 empirical studies on how to teach and learn mathematical knowledge through robotics. The results indicate that (1) most studies were conducted with a small sample size, the largest research groups were elementary school students and secondary school students, most studies used LEGO robots, robots were primarily applied to teach and/or learn graphics, geometry, and algebra, and almost half of the studies taught mathematics by engaging students in game-like interactions with robots; (2) half of the studies adopted a non-experimental research design, and most studies evaluated student performance through observation, test/examination, questionnaires, or verbal interviews; and (3) instructional implications proposed in the 20 papers can be clustered into four themes: human-robot interaction, connections between mathematics and real life, pedagogical suggestions, and facility conditions. The 20 papers suggest that robotics generally plays an active role in mathematics education; however, there are indeed situations in which no significant improvement was found in students’ mathematical learning. In view of this, we prospect the future research perspectives of robot-assisted mathematics education and propose that more rigorous intervention studies could be conducted to further explore the integration of robotics and mathematics education.},

Como principais resultados destaca-se: a) Interfaces tangíveis encontram-se associadas a ambientes interativos que misturam diversos tipos de interfaces; b) apresentam como principal benefício em termos de usabilidade o ganho de naturalidade de uso; c) têm nas metáforas o mais comum recurso cognitivo de concepção e avaliação.},

Nesse sentido, é essencial que a escola prepare os estudantes não apenas para a utilização dos dispositivos computacionais, mas para que entendam as mudanças que causam na vida em sociedade, e, principalmente, para que possam, além de utilizá-los, produzir aquilo que os torna úteis: hardware e software. A Computação envolve mais do que a utilização e a arquitetura das máquinas, uma vez que provém os meios para que as pessoas compreendam, organizem e estruturem seu pensamento para a resolução de problemas. O campo que viabiliza a compreensão e o desenvolvimento dessas habilidades é o Pensamento Computacional. Considerando os diversos aspectos desse processo, neste estudo busca-se compreender e explicitar como os pilares do Pensamento Computacional – a análise, a abstração e a automação – são evidenciados na resolução de problemas na escola. Com o objetivo de acompanhar e entender as estratégias e pilares utilizados pelos estudantes durante a resolução de problemas, a investigação proposta implicou na realização de uma pesquisa qualitativa bibliográfica e exploratória, com entrevista semiestruturada, proposição de dois problemas plugados e três desplugados a quatro estudantes da Educação Básica e o acompanhamento das ações desempenhadas pelos participantes, totalizando seis encontros. As ações desenvolvidas e os questionamentos feitos apontaram que os estudantes evidenciam os pilares do Pensamento Computacional quando aprendem a pensar a resolução de problemas lógicos das atividades escolares e da vida cotidiana.},

However, there are still many challenges to implementing this idea. In this perspective, this article presents a systematic review of the literature related to approaches to learning and teaching programming, and that was published over the last five years (2009-2013) in four major national events in the area (the Brazilian Symposium on Informatics in Education, the Workshop on Computers in School, Workshop on Computer Education and the Brazilian Symposium on Games and Digital Entertainment) and in two major national journals in the area (the Brazilian Journal of Computing in Education Magazine and the New Technologies in Education Journal). The observed results show that researchers prefer to develop tools for teaching algorithms and their research focus mainly on teaching programming to college education in a classroom teaching context, mostly carried out by researchers located in the Northeast, South and Southeast of Brazil. The results also show that publications in this research area have increased in 2013.},

Contudo, é possível minimizar essas dificuldades por meio de técnicas computacionais que não utilizam computadores, é a chamada Computação Desplugada. Esse estudo apresenta a possibilidade de construção de estratégias didáticas para disseminação do Pensamento Computacional entre professores da Educação Infantil, por meio das técnicas de Computação Desplugada. As estratégias são baseadas em algoritmos, sequência e depuração por meio de atividades lúdicas para alunos da Educação Infantil. Para sua implementação, foi realizada uma oficina teórico­prática com 37 professores da rede pública municipal. A proposta comprovou que a maioria dos professores ainda não tinha tido contato com o Pensamento Computacional ou com Computação Desplugada. Observou­se que, apesar de todos manifestarem interesse em novas capacitações sobre as temáticas, boa parte afirmou que provavelmente não replique tais conhecimentos em suas práticas pedagógicas.},

We believe that a person is code-literate when the ability to read and write in the language of computers and to think computationally has been developed. So it is not surprising that computational thinking (CT) is being located at the focus of educational innovation as a set of problem solving skills to be acquired by new generations of students. However, we still lack international consensus on a definition of CT, nor a clear idea of how to incorporate CT to our education systems at various levels. Similarly, there is a striking gap about how to measure and assess CT. In reply, this paper presents the design of a Computational Thinking Test aimed at Spanish students between 12 and 13 years old (grades K-7 \& K-8): we describe the guidelines on which whole test and each of its items have been designed, as well as the content validation process through expert's judgment procedure. Through this process, the initial version of the test (40 items length) was depurated to a 28 items version, which is currently being applied to the target population. Finally, possible limitations of the test and possible concurrency of the same with other international evidence on computational thinking assessment are discussed.},

They then conducted artifact-based video interviews with each other in pairs using their iPad cameras. As discussed in the results, this technique can show a broad range of what young children learn about computational thinking in classroom interventions using ScratchJr than more traditional assessment techniques. It simultaneously provides a developmentally appropriate educational activity (i.e. peer interviews) for early childhood classrooms.},

This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Even though they offer relevant contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the literature on CT\&P in Brazilian K-12 education, for they focus their search only in the Brazilian Computer Society venues. Objective: This work aims to characterize the academic literature on CT\&P in Brazilian K-12 education. Results: we classify selected primary studies on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage/modality, methodological contexts, tools, programming languages, CT skills, learned content, student assessment, curricular choice and theoretical foundations from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: we notice a signiﬁcant increase in the number of studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this ﬁeld of study, as well as several trends and gaps that need to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.},

Therefore it becomes important to educate the general public, and young generations in particular, about the most common technologies.

While several robots exist on the market and are used for education, entertainment or both, none ﬁts with the dream educational tool: promoting creativity and learning, entertaining, cheap and powerful. We addressed this goal by developing the Thymio robot and distributing it during workshops over two years. This paper describes the design principles of the robot, the educational context, and the analysis made with 65 parents after two years of use.

We found that these infants could effectively perform additional gestures, such as one-ﬁnger rotation and two-ﬁnger scale up and down, just as well as basic gestures, despite gender and age differences. We also identiﬁed cognitive and precision issues that may have an impact on the performance and feasibility of several types of interaction (double tap, long press, scale down and two-ﬁnger rotation) and propose a set of design guidelines to mitigate the associated problems and help designers envision effective interaction mechanisms for this challenging age range.},

	abstract = {Research shows that teaching computer programming to children help them develop important 21st century skills such as planning, problem solving, and flexibility of thinking. However, teaching these skills to young children is not an easy task as the existing tools in the market do not seem to be well adapted for them. The aim of this work is to present BlueThinking, an inclusive application to learn programming at early stages. A preliminary evaluation with 5 and 6 years old children was carried out to get the first impressions of the application and detect possible issues. The results show that the degree of children satisfaction with the application was high. Therefore, we believe BlueThinking could be easily used with young children to help them developing the aforementioned skills as well as to introduce them in a subtle way to the world of computer programming.},

We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.},

	abstract = {Entertainment technology increases children’s engagement in educational activities designed to develop abilities ranging from collaborative problem-solving and cognitive attention to self-esteem. However, little research has been done on designing educational and entertaining interactive technology for kindergarten children (up to 5 years old). Furthermore, most of the work in this area has considered traditional input devices such as the mouse and keyboard, which are not suitable for these very young children. More recently, other more intuitive means of interaction (touch and tangible interfaces) and advanced educational artifacts such as robots have emerged. In this work we therefore present a joint collaboration between technologists and kindergarten instructors to design and evaluate a technological platform using a mobile robot for kindergarten instruction, as well as an intuitive and user-friendly tangible user interface. The results obtained suggest the platform is not only usable by kindergarten children, but it also allows them to be fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In addition, the instructors reported that the system was well accepted and praised its versatility in use as a supporting tool for their everyday classroom activities.},

We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70\% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children’s perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.},

To formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (N = 28, Mage = 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was signiﬁcantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.},

Parents may be important for promoting children's STEM learning from touchscreen apps, as parents can help their children learn from other media. However, little research has explored how parents and children use coding apps together for learning, and whether speciﬁc parentchild interactions in these contexts promote children's learning from apps. Therefore, we observed 31 parents and their 4.5- to 5.0-year old children playing a coding app together and coded for spatial talk, question-asking, task-relevant talk, and responsiveness. Results show that parents and children engaged in high-quality interactions during coding app play, with parents and children exhibiting high responsiveness and task-relevant talk, and parents exhibiting a higher proportion of question-asking and spatial talk compared to their children. Importantly, linear regression analyses show that the dyad's ability to stay on task during the coding task predicts children's learning of coding, while question-asking was a negative predictor of children's learning.

Urge a necessidade de novas abordagens para trabalhar a tecnologia na escola.Neste sentido, a abordagem Maker possui grande potencial para enriquecer a formação dosjovens na direção de torná-los produtores de tecnologia e não apenas consumidores.Possibilita impulsionar a aprendizagem interdisciplinar, o protagonismo do estudante e trazermais frequentemente temas relacionados a disciplinas STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). Com a redução do custo dos equipamentos de fabricação digital,o investimento para montagem de um laboratório Maker já equipara-se ao investimento paramontagem do laboratório de informática. O artigo argumenta que o Maker é uma nova abordagem  para  a tecnologia na escola e que espaços Maker deverão substituirgradativamente o laboratório de informática, com muitas vantagens.},

One of the goals of Dr. Scratch, besides supporting teachers in the evaluation tasks, is to act as a stimulus to encourage students to keep on improving their programming skills. Aiming to check its effectiveness regarding this objective, workshops with students in the range from 10 to 14 years were run in 8 schools, in which over 100 learners analyzed one of their Scratch projects with Dr. Scratch, read the information displayed as feedback by Dr. Scratch, and tried to improve their projects using the guidelines and tips offered by the tool. Our results show that at the end of the workshop, students increased their CT score and, consequently, improved their coding skills.},

	abstract = {Computer programming is an essential skill in the 21st century and new policies and frameworks aim at preparing students for computer science-related professions. Today, the development of new interfaces and block-programming languages facilitates the teaching of coding and computational thinking starting in kindergarten. However, as new programming languages that are developmentally appropriate emerge, there is a need to explicitly conceptualize pedagogical approaches for teaching computer science in the early years that embrace the maturational stages of children by inviting play and discovery, socialization, and creativity. Thus, it is not enough to copy models developed for older children, which mostly grew out of traditional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines and instructional practices. This paper describes a pedagogical approach for early childhood computer science called “Coding as Another Language” (CAL), as well as six coding stages, or learning trajectories, that young children go through when exposed to CAL curriculum. CAL is grounded on the principle that learning to program involves learning how to use a new language (a symbolic system of representation) for communicative and expressive functions. This paper proposes that, due to the critical foundational role of language and literacy in the early years, the teaching of computer science can be augmented by models of literacy instruction. CAL supports young children in transitioning through different six coding stages. Case studies of young children using either the KIBO robot or the ScratchJr app will be used to characterize each coding stage and to illustrate the instructional practices of CAL curriculum.},

The goal of many of these interventions is to develop a set of underlying abilities that has been termed computational thinking (CT). This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a “lean” set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) adds to the literature related to the emerging construct of CT, and its relationship to the existing CTt and Bebras instruments, and 2) offers a research-based CT assessment instrument for use by both researchers and educators in the field.},

Our review results indicate that (a) more CT assessments are needed for high school, college students, and teacher professional development programs, (b) most CT assessments focus on students’ programming or computing skills, (c) traditional tests and performance assessments are often used to assess CT skills, and surveys are used to measure students’ CT dispositions, and (d) more reliability and validity ev­ idence needs to be collected and reported in future studies.

	abstract = {The recognition of middle grades as a critical juncture in CS education has led to the widespread development of CS curricula and integration efforts. The goal of many of these interventions is to develop a set of underlying abilities that has been termed computational thinking (CT). This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a “lean” set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) adds to the literature related to the emerging construct of CT, and its relationship to the existing CTt and Bebras instruments, and 2) offers a research-based CT assessment instrument for use by both researchers and educators in the field.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is arising as a set of problem-solving skills that must be acquired by the new generations of students to fully understand and participate in our computer-based world. However, from a psychometric approach, we are still at an early stage regarding the definition and assessment of CT as a psychological variable. One way to advance in this area is to investigate whether ‘computationally talented’ students (i.e., ‘computational top thinkers’) can be detected even before learning to code; and, if so, how to teach them properly to fully develop their highcomputational ability. This paper presents several empirical concatenated studies about the predictive validity of the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), which is administered on a sample of 314 middle school Spanish students (n=314). We report the predictive validity of the CTt, conducted at the beginning of the quarter, with respect to academic performance (Informatics, Mathematics, and Language) and learning analytics in a Code.org course collected at the end of the quarter. We also analyse the predictive validity of the CTt to early distinguish between ‘computational regular thinkers’ and ‘computational top thinkers’ (i.e., those who spontaneously accelerated from the ‘block-based’ programming environment of Code.org to the ‘text-based’ one of Khan Academy). Finally, we perform a case study over two of the students categorized as ‘computational top thinkers’, in which one of their coding products written in Processing JavaScript is described. Our results demonstrate that ‘computationally talented’ students can be detected in middle school, and that these subjects have the ability to accelerate in the Computer Science Education standards between 1 and 2 years compared to the regular learners. This could have major implications on the emerging computing curricula, which should take into account these individual differences in computational ability and ‘learning-how-to-code’ speed to ensure an appropriate progression for every student.},

	abstract = {We live in a society full of digital and programmable objects. In this context, being code-literate involves an inescapable requirement for any citizen of the XXI century. We believe that a person is code-literate when the ability to read and write in the language of computers and to think computationally has been developed. So it is not surprising that computational thinking (CT) is being located at the focus of educational innovation as a set of problem solving skills to be acquired by new generations of students. However, we still lack international consensus on a definition of CT, nor a clear idea of how to incorporate CT to our education systems at various levels. Similarly, there is a striking gap about how to measure and assess CT. In reply, this paper presents the design of a Computational Thinking Test aimed at Spanish students between 12 and 13 years old (grades K-7 \& K-8): we describe the guidelines on which whole test and each of its items have been designed, as well as the content validation process through expert's judgment procedure. Through this process, the initial version of the test (40 items length) was depurated to a 28 items version, which is currently being applied to the target population. Finally, possible limitations of the test and possible concurrency of the same with other international evidence on computational thinking assessment are discussed.},

However, there is still no consensus on a CT deﬁnition or how to measure it. In response, we attempt to address both issues from a psychometric approach. On the one hand, a Computational Thinking Test (CTt) is administered on a sample of 1,251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade, so its descriptive statistics and reliability are reported in this paper. On the second hand, the criterion validity of the CTt is studied with respect to other standardized psychological tests: the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) battery, and the RP30 problem-solving test. Thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for CT measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of CT through its associations with key related psychological constructs. Results show statistically signiﬁcant correlations at least moderately intense between CT and: spatial ability (r ¼ 0.44), reasoning ability (r ¼ 0.44), and problemsolving ability (r ¼ 0.67). These results are consistent with recent theoretical proposals linking CT to some components of the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence, and corroborate the conceptualization of CT as a problem-solving ability.},

	abstract = {Given that computational thinking (CT) is still a blurry psychological construct, its assessment remains as a thorny, unresolved issue. Hence, in recent years, several assessment tools have been developed from different approaches and operational deﬁnitions of CT. However, very little research has been conducted to study whether these instruments provide convergent measurements, and how to combine them properly in educational settings. In response, we ﬁrst review a myriad of CT assessment tools and classify them according to their evaluative approach. Second, we report the results of two convergent validity studies that involve three of these CT assessment tools, which come from different perspectives: the Computational Thinking Test, the Bebras Tasks, and Dr. Scratch. Finally, we propose a comprehensive model to evaluate the development of CT within educational scenarios and interventions, which includes the aforementioned and other reviewed assessment tools. Our comprehensive model intends to assess CT along every cognitive level of Bloom’s taxonomy and throughout the various stages of typical educational interventions. Furthermore, the model explicitly indicates how to harmoniously combine the different types of CT assessment tools in order to give answer to the most common research questions in the ﬁeld of CT Education. Thus, this contribution may lead scholars and policy-makers to perform accurate evaluation designs of CT according to their inquiry goals.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is emerging as a key set of problem-solving skills that must be developed by the new generations of digital learners. However, there is still a lack of consensus on a formal CT definition, on how CT should be integrated in educational settings, and specially on how CT can be properly assessed. The latter is an extremely relevant and urgent topic because without reliable and valid assessment tools, CT might lose its potential of making its way into educational curricula. In response, this paper is aimed at presenting the convergent validity of one of the major recent attempts to assess CT from a summative-aptitudinal perspective: the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). The convergent validity of the CTt is studied in middle school Spanish samples with respect to other two CT assessment tools, which are coming from different perspectives: the Bebras Tasks, built from a skill-transfer approach; and Dr. Scratch, an automated tool designed from a formativeiterative approach. Our results show statistically significant, positive and moderately intense, correlations between the CTt and a selected set of Bebras Tasks (r=0.52); and between the CTt and Dr. Scratch (predictive value r=0.44; concurrent value r=0.53). These results support the statement that CTt is partially convergent with Bebras Tasks and with Dr. Scratch. Finally, we discuss if these three tools are complementary and may be combined in middle school.},

Nevertheless, efforts involving the formal assessment of computational thinking has primarily focused on middle school grades and above; and are mostly based on the analysis of projects in specific programming environments. A Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt), aimed at early ages, and based on the Computational Thinking Test [1], has been designed including several improvements; submitted to a content validation process through expert´s judgement procedure; and administered to Primary School students. The BCTt design is considered adequate by experts and results show a high reliability for the assessment of CT in Primary School, particularly in first educational stages.},

Then we focus on the analysis of one particular toy, and show how attackers can decrypt communications to and from a target device, and perhaps more worryingly, the attackers can also inject audio into the toy so the children listens to any arbitrary audio file the attacker sends to the toy. This last attack raises new safety concerns that manufacturers of smart toys should prevent.},

	abstract = {Toys are play products designed for leisure and social play activities. Today, play products increasingly incorporate hardware and software computation, often connecting to online services and other computing devices, thus being commonly referred to as “smart toys.” Accordingly, such products can also be categorized as user interfaces as they allow human interaction with digital contents using the physical toys’ inputs and outputs. Here we propose the idea of Toy-User-Interfaces (ToyUI) and relate them to the domains of human-computer interaction, mixed reality, and the Internet of Things. We surveyed and categorized a multitude of ToyUIs, gathering information from research papers and toy companies by performing both a systematic mapping (covering research from 2008 to 2017) and an industrial mapping (covering releases from 2012 to 2017). The resulting 297 items were then analyzed according to our classiﬁcation model, being divided into four categories, eight genres, and 22 setups, considering the play features and the interface features of such items. The classiﬁcation model and the analysis of the results allowed us to identify six trends in design and technology for ToyUI. Ultimately, our research ﬁndings may guide the future of ToyUI projects for researchers, designers, educators, therapists, and end-users.},

To examine the toys, the authors apply a framework developed based on Gibson’s theory of affordances and Palmer’s external representations. The authors look speciﬁcally at the toys: interface design, intended play scenario and representational conventions for computational ideas.},

Essential factors which distinguish different Mixed Reality display systems from each other are presented, first by means of a table in which the nature of the underlying scene, how it is viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, and then by means of a three dimensional taxonomic framework, comprising: Extent of World Knowledge (EWK), Reproduction Fidelity (RF) and Extent of Presence Metaphor (EPM). A principal objective of the taxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a framework for classifying research across different disciplines.},

In this article, we attempt to provide a new classification method to standardize the definition of virtual, augmented and mixed realities. First, a quick overview of existing taxonomies is made, then we present our classification which is based on three criteria we called 3iVClass (Immersion, Interaction, Information). Finally, in order to verify its reliability, we used this classification to propose a definition of mixed reality.},

Dr. Wagon is a tangible programming toy that includes a series of programming blocks and a wagon-shaped robot. The programming blocks include basic functions ("move"), conditions ("if" statements), and loops ("repeat"). These blocks can be connected in various ways to control the behavior of the wagon.

	abstract = {This essay is a discussion of the KJ method developed by a Japanese ethnologist, Jiro Kawakita. A brief biography of Kawakita and the history of the KJ method is described. The KJ method was developed as a result of having difficulties in interpreting ethnographic data in Nepal. The KJ method builds upon Charles Pierce's notions of abduction and relies upon intuitive non-logical thinking processes. Kawakita's methods were developed and diffused throughout Japanese management and educational circles. Kawakita believes that his methodology has the potential of liberating humanity from the mechanistic philosophy imposed by Western Civilization. The KJ method, according to Kawakita has universal applicability and does not only conform to Japanese culture and management decision-making processes which are generally based on the group-orientation model. This simplistic group-orientation model of Japanese society is being criticized by anthropologists such as Harumi Befu. Kawakita argues that human nature is universal, and that the KJ method, as a means of decision-making can be utilized in all societies throughout the world to implement social and economic development.},

This report provides a comprehensive overview of CT skills for schoolchildren, encompassing recent research findings and initiatives at grassroots and policy levels. It also offers a better understanding of the core concepts and attributes of CT and its potential for compulsory education. The study adopts a mostly qualitative approach that comprises extensive desk research, a survey of Ministries of Education and semi-structured interviews, which provide insights from experts, practitioners and policy makers.

Toys are selected for their varying degrees of autonomy and responsiveness, and for their lasting popularity, or capacity to captivate commonly held passions. As will become clear through the examples, animated toys need not be computational to qualify as AniMates. Many classical toys exhibit creature-like qualities, such as self-propelled movement (wind-up toys) or the ability to keep a bearing (tops and gyros). And many no-tech or low-tech toys exist, which afford the thrill of controlling things at a distance (kites, string puppets). My purpose is to highlight some of the relational qualities that, beyond functionality, endow AniMates with the power to draw us in, amuse and delight us and, above all, re-enact some of the hurdles that growing up entails---an indirect hint to toy-bots/tech-toys designers.},

even better is to create it.” As part of my work, I explore design processes in school education in India. The intent is to integrate in curricula, design processes through series of design in education workshops. Why deploy toy design as a medium to achieve such a goal? Everyone can easily connect to toys and games. We usually
start the workshop with a study of a heritage toy. As part of “toys and tales” workshop
series, usually one specific toy design or concept is selected and explored through various ‘Tale’ concepts. This process helps create many ideas for toyproduct design. The participants are generally teachers of education, therapy, child development and psychology. They are able to develop new ideas in these workshops.
The aim is to empower educators and enhance their creative abilities in their respective work by introducing design process, relating toy and game design. I teach product design at a university in India. We felt the need to introduce space and facilities whereby both digital and tangible toys and games may co-exist. The design students are encouraged to incorporate elements of play in their product
and interior design projects. Students value this approach as it brings a special design process. In my studio, I design and produce toys in small quantities. One of the toy design projects, “Khel Manthan (Churning-Learning) – handcrafted storyteller and storymaker”, is designed and developed with a community. The experiment
is used as one of the case studies during design in education workshops, to highlight the significance of the design process. I will be presenting some of the experiences from these workshops and courses with various groups of school teachers, university faculty, students, and development communities involved in training. My presentation will highlight the process of design development work
through group participation.},

	abstract = {Computadores impactam em quase todos os aspectos de nossas vidas, porém as escolas não conseguem acompanhar esse caminho sem volta. A simples utilização massiva de aparatos tecnológicos na sala de aula não garante a melhoria do ensino, porém pode ser o meio pelo qual os estudantes encontram alternativas para a solução de problemas complexos. O Pensamento Computacional é uma abordagem de ensino que usa diversas técnicas oriundas da Ciência da Computação e vem gerando um novo foco educacional no quesito inovação nas escolas mundiais como um conjunto de competências de solução de problemas que devem ser compreendidos por uma nova geração de estudantes em conjunto com as novas competências do século 21 (i.e., pensamento crítico, colaboração, etc.). Até o momento, não há um consenso de metodologia de ensino e disponibilidade de material para atender as expectativas dos professores. Para auxiliar sanar essa incerteza, esta pesquisa tem como objetivo a verificação da possibilidade de desenvolver o Pensamento Computacional na Educação Básica utilizando exclusivamente atividades desplugadas (sem o uso de computadores) em estudantes da educação primária para que crianças em regiões/escolas onde não há computadores/dispositivos eletrônicos, Internet e até mesmo energia elétrica também possam se beneficiar desse método. Os resultados obtidos através de uma abordagem Quase-Experimental em escolas Espanholas e Brasileiras, apresentam dados estatísticos que apontam uma melhoria significativa no desempenho dos estudantes que tiveram atividades de Pensamento Computacional Desplugado em ambos os países.},

We found that these infants could effectively perform additional gestures, such as one-ﬁnger rotation and two-ﬁnger scale up and down, just as well as basic gestures, despite gender and age differences. We also identiﬁed cognitive and precision issues that may have an impact on the performance and feasibility of several types of interaction (double tap, long press, scale down and two-ﬁnger rotation) and propose a set of design guidelines to mitigate the associated problems and help designers envision effective interaction mechanisms for this challenging age range.},

Nos estudos quantitativos realizados, são obtidas as taxas anuais de evasão e aplicada a técnica estatística de Análise de Sobrevivência e mineração de regras de associação via algoritmo Apriori. É apresentada também uma análise qualitativa a partir de questionários aplicados a alunos evadidos em cursos superiores de Computação da UnB para verificação das causas de evasão. Os resultados obtidos com os estudos dos dados do INEP são apresentados por instituições públicas e privadas. São comparadas, inicialmente, as evasões nas grandes áreas do conhecimento de acordo com a classificação adotada pela Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Econômico (OCDE). Após a comparação da evasão nessas grandes áreas, é feito um detalhamento para a grande área de Ciências, Matemática e Computação e posteriormente para a área de Computação. Um estudo de caso das causas da evasão em cursos da área de Computação foi conduzido na UnB, onde foram estudados os cursos de Bacharelado em Ciência da Computação, Licenciatura em Computação, Engenharia de Software e Engenharia de Computação para levantamento de causas de evasão nesses cursos. Foram obtidas evidências de que a relação candidatos/vagas é inversamente proporcional à evasão, de que os cursos da grande área de Ciências, Matemática e Computação que requerem maior uso de conhecimentos matemáticos e de abstração algorítmica possuem maiores taxas de evasão e de que o sexo, a forma de ingresso na instituição e ser ou não cotista afetam as taxas de evasões nos cursos na área de Computação.},

Marker systems typically have two stages, hypothesis generation from unique image features and verification/identification. A set of criteria for high robustness and practical use are identified and then optimized to produce the ARTag fiducial marker system. An edge-based method robust to lighting and partial occlusion is used for the hypothesis stage, and a reliable digital coding system is used for the identification and verification stage.

It was adopted an incremental development that allowed to evolve the interface from tests with users. The tests performed with 9 users, being a blind one, revealed that: (1) even without knowing Braille the blind user was able to use the interface satisfactorily; (2) the interface serves a wide age range from 8 years and; (3) the users performed better when the interface symbols were expanded.},

This tool was conceived speciﬁcally for children, applying design techniques to determinate the best shape, material and typography for young students. The content is displayed by projectors, which exhibit the required information only on the blocks surface using an automatic projector calibration technique. The blocks are tracked through a frame marker using the moving edges approach with multiple hypotheses to improve robustness. ARBlocks was evaluated from three different perspectives: computational, educational and user experience. Technical results show that the platform achieves a real time frame rate and an accurate projector calibration, as well as precisely displays information over the blocks. Additionally, in the educational evaluation the teachers interviewed asserted that the ARBlocks has a great potential and can be a very useful tool to be used in classrooms. Regarding the user experience, both teachers and children were excited in using this system continuously.},

There is evidence that variations in the spatial language young children hear, which directs their attention to important aspects of the spatial environment, may be one of the mechanisms that contributes to these differences. To investigate how play affects variations in language, parents and children were assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: free play with blocks, guided play, or play with preassembled structures (Study 1). Parents in the guided play condition produced significantly higher proportions of spatial talk than parents in the other two conditions, and children in the guided play condition produced significantly more spatial talk than those in the free play condition. Study 2 established baselines of spatial language during activities not involving spatial materials. Proportions of spatial words were lower than those in any of the conditions of Experiment 1. In sum, interaction with blocks naturally elicits elevated levels of spatial language, especially in the context of guided play, suggesting simple-to-execute educational interventions.},

	school = {Rochester Institute of Technology},
	abstract = {Nowadays, software systems are essential for businesses, users and society. At the same time such systems are growing both in complexity and size. In this context, developing high-quality software is a challenging and expensive activity for the software industry. Since software organizations are always limited by their budget, personnel and time, it is not a trivial task to allocate testing and code-review resources to areas that require the most attention. To overcome the above problem, researchers have developed software bug prediction models that can help practitioners to predict the most bug-prone software entities. Although, software bug prediction is a very popular research area, yet its industrial adoption remains limited.

In this thesis, we investigate three possible issues with the current state-of-the-art in software bug prediction that affect the practical usability of prediction models. First, we argue that current bug prediction models implicitly assume that all bugs are the same without taking into consideration their impact. We study the impact of bugs in terms of experience of the developers required to fix them. Second, only few studies investigate the impact of specific type of bugs. Therefore, we characterize a severe type of bug called Blocking bugs, and provide approaches to predict them early on. Third, false-negative files are buggy files that bug prediction models incorrectly as non-buggy files. We argue that a large number of false-negative files makes bug prediction models less attractive for developers. In our thesis, we quantify the extent of false-negative files, and manually inspect them in order to better understand their nature.},

Learning trajectories ({LTs}) for computational thinking ({CT}) topics will help to guide emerging curriculum development efforts for computer science in elementary school. This study describes the development of an {LT} for Debugging. We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K–8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning. The concepts were organized into the {LT} presented within. In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful. Finally, we illustrate how the Debugging {LT} has guided our efforts to develop an integrated mathematics and {CT} curriculum for grades 3–5.},

Few K-12 programming environments are designed to teach debugging, and most debugging research were conducted on college-aged students.

Apart from the perspective of prior literature, we identiﬁed student behaviors in relation to problem solving stages, and correlated these behaviors with student prior programming experience and performance. We found that in our programming game, debugging required deeper understanding than writing new codes. We also found that problem solving behaviors were signiﬁcantly correlated with students’ self-explanation quality, number of code edits, and prior programming experience. This study increased our understanding of younger students’ problem solving behavior, and provided actionable suggestions to the future design of debugging exercises in {BOTS} and similar environments.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a study that investigated the ways that young children interact with discrete programmable digital toys in a free play setting. One intention was to see whether this interaction would address some of the requirements of the Digital Technologies subject in the Australian Curriculum. The study was implemented in two phases in consecutive years involving teachers and students from two early childhood classes. Researchers worked with the teachers to provide the children with opportunities to use two types of digital toys - the Sphero and the Beebot. The children were observed as they interacted with these toys and their interactions analysed using a checklist of behaviours. It was found that without some explicit scaffolding the children did not tend to demonstrate any actions that could be associated with an understanding of ‘algorithms’. However, they did demonstrate motivation, engagement, and increased proficiency and recognition with using the hardware and software of these digital systems. © 2017, Australian Council for Computers in Education.

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to broadly elaborate on how programming can be understood as a new teaching scope in preschools, focusing specifically on debugging as one of the phases involved in learning to program. The research question How can debugging as part of teaching and learning programming be understood as multimodal learning? has guided the analysis and the presentation of the data. In this study, and its analysis process, we have combined a multimodal understanding of teaching and learning practices with understandings of programming and how it is practiced. Consequently, the multidisciplinary approach in this study, combining theories from social sciences with theories and concepts from computer science, is central throughout the article. This is therefore also a creative, explorative process as there are no clear norms to follow when conducting multidisciplinary analyses. The data consist of video recordings of teaching sessions with children and a teacher engaged in programming activities. The video material was recorded in a preschool setting during the school year 2017–2018 and consists of 25 sessions of programming activities with children, who were four or five years old. The results show how debugging in early childhood education is a multimodal activity socially established by use of speech, pointing and gaze. Our findings also indicate that artefacts are central to learning debugging, and a term ‘instructional artefacts’ is therefore added. Finally, the material shows how basic programming concepts and principles can be explored with young children.},

	abstract = {In vivo exposure is the evidence based treatment for small animal phobias. However, this type of treatment still present a low treatment seek rate and a high drop-out rate, due to its aversive character for the patients. New technologies such as Virtual Reality ({VR}) and augmented reality ({AR}) have started to show their potential in anxiety disorders, including small animal phobia treatment and have demonstrated their efficacy. However, these systems still present limitations regarding the possibility to offer an optimal therapy to the phobia sufferers. This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of new {AR} exposure therapy – a projection-based system (P-{ARET}) for small animal phobias in the short (post-treatment), and long term (3- and 12-month follow-up). Four patients diagnosed with cockroach phobia participated in this pilot treatment study. The results show that all patients improved significantly in main outcome measures after the treatment. The study also follows a strategy of benchmarking, in which the results obtained from the evaluation of the P-{ARET} system in clinical setting are compared with two other clinically validated phobia therapies (traditional, in vivo exposure therapy ({IVET}); virtual reality exposure therapy ({VRET}); and {AR} exposure therapy with the use of a head-mounted display ({HMD}-{ARET}). The results indicate that the clinical effectiveness of new projection-based {AR} system for small animal phobia treatment was comparable to those achieved by the therapeutic conditions in other studies. However, the P-{ARET} system brings some advantages in terms of patient-therapist communication and more natural interaction with the system.},

The first exhibition is an interactive exploration about the nature of light. Visitors can experiment with additive subtractive color models. We engage them with questions, and they have to reply using cards to find out answers. This exhibit is suitable for children. The second exhibition is about map exploration and creation for Visually Impaired Persons ({VIP}). {VIP} generally use tactile maps with braille to learn about an unknown environment. However, these maps are not accessible to the 80\% of {VIP} who don't read braille. Our prototype augments raised-line maps with audio output. The third exhibition is destined to be used for scientific outreach. It enables the creation of artificial neural networks ({ANN}) using tangible interfaces. Neurons are represented by laser-cut diamond shaped tokens, and the data to learn is printed on cards. The {ANN} learns to differentiate shapes, and the whole learning process is made visible and interactive. These three applications demonstrate the capabilities of our hardware and software development kit in different scenarios. At {ReVo}, each demonstration will have its own setup and interactive space.},

Yet, to our knowledge, there are no tangible based systems for training this math concept. Building on theories of cognition and learning, we developed {MaR}-T, a projector-camera setup. This paper is a step towards investigating the effects of projection-based mixed-reality ({MR}) system with tangibles on nonsymbolic number representation of 3- to 5-year-old children. We present our user studies with a total of 14 participants, conducted to observe their interaction with the setup and the possible effects of our design on learning. The results indicate that {MaR}-T can provide active, engaging, and social learning, and our insights can inspire other interaction design and education studies.},

	abstract = {Learning analytics and educational data mining are introducing a number of new techniques and frameworks for studying learning. The scalability and complexity of these novel techniques has afforded new ways for enacting education research and has helped scholars gain new insights into human cognition and learning. Nonetheless, there remain some domains for which pure computational analysis is currently infeasible. One such area, which is particularly important today, is open-ended, hands-on, engineering design tasks. These open-ended tasks are becoming increasingly prevalent in both K–12 and post-secondary learning institutions, as educators are adopting this approach in order to teach students real-world science and engineering skills (e.g., the “Maker Movement”). This paper highlights findings from a combined human–computer analysis of students as they complete a short engineering design task. The study uncovers novel insights and serves to advance the field’s understanding of engineering design patterns. More specifically, this paper uses machine learning on hand-coded video data to identify general patterns in engineering design and develop a fine-grained representation of how experience relates to engineering practices. Finally, the paper concludes with ideas on how the specific findings from this study can be used to improve engineering education and the nascent field of “making” and digital fabrication in education. We also discuss how human–computer collaborative analyses can grow the learning analytics community and make learning analytics more central to education research.},
